# 0x0C. Web server

## Resources:books:

### [0. Transfer a file to your server](./0-transfer_file)
* Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:


### [1. Install nginx web server](./1-install_nginx_web_server)
* 


### [2. Setup a domain name](./2-setup_a_domain_name)
* .TECH Domains is one of the top domain providers. They are known for the stability and quality of their DNS hosting solution. 


### [3. Redirection](./3-redirection)
* Readme:


### [4. Not found page 404](./4-not_found_page_404)
* Configure your Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string Ceci n'est pas une page.


### [5. Design a beautiful 404 page](./5-design_a_beautiful_404_page)
* Some of my favorites:


### [6. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)](./7-puppet_install_nginx_web_server.pp)
* Time to practice configuring your server with Puppet! Just as you did before, weâ€™d like you to install and configure an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. To save time and effort, you should also include resources in your manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.
